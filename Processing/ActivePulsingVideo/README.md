##intent: create a 3d simulation of the different geometries for Active

###control: 

mouse button cycles the colors

keyboard keys enable or disables the following mode to make it easy to view from the side
* Q - places the interface in to mouse mode so you might drage the form around to view from different angles
* S - puts a 90 degree rotation on the form. this is helpful to view from the side


###bugs: video capture and 3d rendering dont really play well together in processing. i'll move to the real hardware.
